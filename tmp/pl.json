    "I created this website for my dad's 62nd birthday. I promised him once that I will\n                write something where he could store the books from our house. Application can store a user home books\n                as the online library. The whole idea is split into two sections: creating books and creating shelves. User\n                can then assign a book to a shelf.": "",
